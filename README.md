npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd warehouse_management_system
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Keycloak Setup
```bash
cd keycloak-26.2.4

# For Windows: bin\kc.bat start-dev
```

## Default Ports
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Keycloak: http://localhost:8081

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a microservices-like architecture:
- The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API
- Authentication is delegated to Keycloak
- The backend services are organized into logical modules (Inventory, Warehouse, Shipment, etc.)
- Role-based routing in the frontend shows different interfaces based on user permissions

## Security

The application implements OAuth2 security with Keycloak:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Protected API endpoints
- Secure user management
